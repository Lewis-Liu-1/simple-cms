Product Group:Power-up							
Test Type:beta  		
Software:Recommended  			
Classification:Generic							
Standard:NZS4512-2003							
Aim / Purpose of Test:Verify that the panel powers up as expected and also manages off-normal conditions correctly									
Set-up Instructions/Equipment Required:
Ensure to use B401R bases and reverse polarity capable iDevices to test this product									

Test Procedure:									
Step 1:Terminate all zones and global hush with 10k EOL, then power up and wait for ~1 minute								
Exp result:After power-up (all LEDs flashing) the normal LED flashes at a rate of 600ms ON, 200ms OFF
